<Ozymandias>
    <line>I met <person>a traveller</person> from <Place>an antique land</Place>,</line>
        <line>Who said—“Two vast and <Structure>trunkless legs of stone</Structure> </line>
    <line>Stand in the <place>desert</place>. . . . Near them, on the sand,</line>
    <line>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</line>
    <line>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</line>
    <line>Tell that its <person>sculptor</person> well those passions read</line>
    <line>Which yet survive, <Structure>stamped on these lifeless things</Structure>,</line>
    <line>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</line>
    <line>And on the pedestal, these words appear:</line>
    <line>My name is <person>Ozymandias, King of Kings</person>;</line>
    <line>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</line>
    <line>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</line>
    <line>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</line>
    <line>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</line>
</Ozymandias>
